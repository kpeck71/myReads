# MyReads Project

This is my first draft for the final assessment project of Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

The MyReads app allows the user to see books they are Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Have Read. They can also search a collection of available books on the /search page, and move any books to their desired shelf. This collection of books is powered by the React BooksAPI from Udacity [https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/]
